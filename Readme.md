#### Overview of project
The present study characterized functional network properties across rest, reward processing, and executive functioning states to deepen our understanding of network-level deficits common across disorders, or specific to varying forms of psychopathology (via bifactor model). 

#### Data sources, description
This project utilizes data from the ABCD Study Dataset

#### Approach
This study used a bifactor model of psychopathology established in [[Moore et. al, 2020]](https://www.scholars.northwestern.edu/en/publications/criterion-validity-and-relationships-between-alternative-hierarch). Graph theory was used to establish functional topology metrics
